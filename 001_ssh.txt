Needed to enable ssh_sysadm_login bool using setsebool. Probably because I'm
using the targeted policy and my user is unconfined_u.

Needed to disable openrc pam in /etc/pam.d/system-login. It was causing it to
try and access something in /run/openrc.

Needed to manually set sshd_exec_t context on /usr/lib/misc/sshd-auth. This is
fixed in selinux-base-policy version 20250618 which is in testing, so I added to
/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/ to install it.

Then, to upgrade selinux modules:

Go to /usr/share/selinux/targeted and run semodule -i *.pp
(I had to disable the networkmanager module here because the base module
conflicted)

semodule -B
(This is what regenerates /etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_contexts,
which seems to be what restorecon reads)

restorecon -nvr /
(and then without n after confirming)
