After upgrading to the newer base policy, portage stopped being able to fetch.
It turns out there's now a bool portage_fetch_all_ports which is disabled by
default. I didn't find it in the repo at version 20250618, instead I found it on
the main branch. It turns out gentoo has a custom patch including it.
