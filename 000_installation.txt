Firstly, it turns out I can't switch to the profile while installing Gentoo. Use
the non-selinux profile for initial installation and then follow the SELinux
installation instructions [1]. I couldn't get the recommended mcs working, so I
went with targeted instead.

Had to patch ebuild for sys-libs/libselinux. Modified the ebuild as suggested in
the musl porting notes [2] and ran ebuild manifest on it so it would pass
verification and install.

sys-libs/libsemanage wouldn't compile. Downloaded the linked patch in this bug
report [3] and added to /etc/portage/patches/sys-libs/libsemanage/.
